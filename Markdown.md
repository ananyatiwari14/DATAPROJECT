Jammu and Kashmir, which contains Kashmir, a contested territory, witnessed increased peaceful protests as well as insurgency and violence since 2016. This trend peaked in 2021. The entire region was under a harsh lockdown for 2 years from 2019 when the central government revoked Article 370. <br><br>

## History <br><br>

After the Partition of the British-ruled subcontinent in 1947, Kashmir, which was and continues to be Muslim-dominated, was taken over by the new Indian government and military rule ensued. Article 370 of the Indian constitution gave the state (comprising also of the regions of Jammu, which is Hindu-dominated, and Ladakh, which is sparsely populated with Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists) a special status. This gave the region the right to have a separate flag, state constitution, and internal governance constituting Kashmiri and Jammu locals in the government. Despite this, Kashmir was conflict-ridden and ruled by the military. <br><br>

Citing that Article 370 had fed the flames of separatism, the BJP-ruled central government revoked it and separated the regions into two Union Territories (administered directly by the central government only without an option of elections) of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh respectively. This revocation of August 2019 was followed by a stringent state-wide lockdown which lasted till Septemeber 2021. Curfews, disconnection of the internet, and communication blockades were justified as a means to control anticipated violence and unrest following this revocation. <br><br>

## Data shows increased protest activity in J&K since 2016 <br><br>

(Darker areas saw more incidents, period 2016-22)<br><br>

The J&K region saw over 18,000 incidents from 2016 overall, the highest of all states. Most incidents reported were peaceful protests. Only Punjab - which rebelled against the 3 farm laws from July 2020 - witnessed more protests than the region during the course of this period. These protests - both in the region and in Punjab - peaked in 2021. <br><br>

Peaceful protests in J&K occurred far more than the violent clashes.<br><br>

 
!['J&K saw more peaceful protests than other incidents'](/three.jpg)<br><br>



As per the data, most protests occured in the Jammu region as a whole from 2016-22, followed by the capital city of Kashmir - Srinagar. <br><br>

| Jammu     	| 4130 	|
|-----------	|------	|
| Srinagar  	| 2833 	|
| New Delhi 	| 2632 	|
| Ludhiana  	| 2127 	|
| Bathinda  	| 2087 	|<br><br><br>

These protests in the Srinagar city for example, range from student, labor and community protests over a wide-range of issues. These issues include protests against encounter killings, pro-separationist protests, labor protests, protests against police forces, women-rights marches, protests calling attention to developmental issues, stone-pelting incidents by the people against patrolling police and/or military, politically inclined protests, protests on human rights issues, among others. <br><br>

When the lockdown was imposed in the J&K region in August 2019 following the abrogation of Article 370, it led to a communication blockade. Internet was suspended, and, for the first time, a 24-hour curfew was imposed. Internet shutdowns have occured before in Kashmir, but the 24-hour lockdown and curfew was a new move, said Safwat Zargar, a Srinagar-based journalist writing for Indian media. He said that even before the abrogation, the forces had been clamping down on any form of separationist opposition for weeks. "Months before the lockdown was imposed, they had been clamping down in the Jamaat Islamia, Hurriyat, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front..." Moreover, the Public Safety Act - widely used as a pretext to arrest separationist activity in Kashmir - was amended and now Kashmiris arrested could be sent to any jail across the country, which was another novel thing, he said. <br><br>

Qazi Shibli was one such journalist there who was arrested before this lockdown was imposed. He remained in prison for 9-months. "I had broken a story for the Kashmiri (local) press 12-days before the abrogation that the government was going to do it. Before, nobody - not even the Kashmiri local officials and politicians, thought that they (Indian government) would do it," Shibli said. When he was released in April 2020, mid-COVID-19 lockdown, he resumed work, but a few months later he was arrested again for 18-days for raising questions about an encounter killing by the forces. "I had raised doubts about this and later it turned out to be a fake encounter," he said. <br><br>

Now, with the J&K region losing its special status and with no representation and elections, the people are immensely vulnerable and disempowered. <br><br>

This is reflected in the data on peaceful protests coming from the region, which is seeing a major suppression of its local media. (Shibli is so worried that he has fled Kashmir.) Since 2016 protests increased in number, and saw a decline in 2020 when the lockdown was in place. In September 2021 the lockdown officially ended, but the protests peaked. But in 2022, the protests have lessened in number - both due to the fact that only a few months have passed and due to increased fear of suppression in a state lacking means of local representation in the administration. <br><br>



!['J&K saw more peaceful protests peak in 2021, and these have been growing over the course of 6 years’](/four.jpg)<br><br>

Both journalists say that despite Kashmir's culture of both peaceful and violent rebellion against the Indian state, since Article 370 there is massive fear in people. "After the abrogation it was very difficult to protest - yet people did it such as in Srinagar, which saw many protests. It was the first time (due to a 24-hour curfew, instead of the customary 12-hour curfew) that people simply could not leave their homes," said Zargar. Zargar said that many such protests also occured in Jammu, where the business owners were against the right of "outsiders" (non J&K people) of setttling in the region and conducting business there. Previously, Article 370 had made it impossible for non J&K residents to own land in the region - now this is no longer a reality and has stoked immense unease in residents of both Jammu and Kashmir. <br><br> 

People of Kashmir are paralyzed with fear. "The situation is quite disturbing and tough. Earlier, protests happened and the police let it go. Now, the police arrests and files FIRs against the protesters," said Shibli, citing how recently people were protesting against the closure of a mosque in Srinagar known for political activities, only to find that more than 15 of the protesters were arrested the next day. People are disempowered and it is quite tragic, he added. <br><br>

## Protests are rising in India

The ACLED’s data shows that in states such as J&K, Punjab, and Odisha, there have been increasing riots, violence, and peaceful protests since 2016. The data tracks incidents of arrests, armed clashes, mob violence, peaceful protests, violent demonstrations, excessive force against protesters, and many others.<br><br>

Peaceful protests have been rising steadily over the years in India in many states, though the causes are multiple, and participants are diverse groups including those of opposing political parties, unions and student groups. Over 74,000 overall peaceful protests were recorded from 2016 onwards. <br><br>

Intriguingly, the trend of rising peaceful protests in many Indian states - instigated or led by a wide variety of people, including political parties, students, unions, etc - have shown an immense rise over the course of the years. This is especially true for those states with the most incidents, such as Punjab and Assam. Their trends are similar to what is seen in Jammu and Kashmir. <br><br>


!['Protests have increased in states with most reported incidents of this activity’](/six.jpg)<br><br>

States such as J&K, Punjab, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, and others (except for Delhi and Haryana) have witnessed increasing protest activity recently, often peaking in 2019. They reduced in number in 2020 due to COVID-19 and in many states declined thereafter. Either the media is suddenly more vigilant and recording/reporting protest activity - or the people are truly showcasing their democratic right to protests more fiercely than they did in 2016. <br><br><br>

## **MARKDOWN** <br><br>
 
In this dataset collected by the ACLED, events in India from 2016-2022 - such as peaceful protests, riots, insurgency, police violence, mob violence - has been recorded. They are collected via news reports. My goal in this analysis was to figure out any obvious trends. <br><br>
 
1. Even though the data set looked clean, I opened it via OpenRefine. <br><br>
2. I could individually use the cluster/facet functions to explore each column. <br><br>
For example, when I used the text facet on the Sub_event_type (which states what form of event occurred such as mob violence, peaceful protests, etc), I could see for myself the various kinds of activity that have been recorded. <br><br> 
3. I immediately noticed that “Peaceful protest” was recorded 74544 times, way higher than any other activity. Image below shows this:<br><br><br>
 
!['Peaceful protests are highest'](/numberone.jpg) <br><br><br>
 
4. Similarly, the text facet for the “year” column revealed the most occurrences that happened in 2019. <br><br>
5. The occurrences peaked in 2019, and then dropped. <br><br>
6. I opened the file on Google sheets. <br><br>
7. I froze the rows displaying the headers. <br><br>
8. I opened a PIVOT TABLE.<br><br>
 
9. Checking the states, Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab saw most activities occur during all the years. However, Punjab saw the most peaceful protests (over 11,000 versus over 9,000 in J&K), even though overall, most activities occurred in J&K. This can be explained as since 2020 farmers across Punjab were ferociously and relentlessly agitating against the 3 farm laws passed in July 2020. <br><br>
10. With these facets, I could already see that the trends for all states are the following: <br>
 *Most of these activities are peaceful protests. <br>
 *These activities peaked in 2019. <br>
 *They have dropped significantly since, especially from 2020 onwards. <br><br>
Since I did not need to clean up anything, I did not download this OpenRefine file and opened up this CSV on Google sheets for further analysis. <br><br>
 
11. After opening up Google Sheets, I froze the top row and opened a PIVOT TABLE. <br><br>
 
12. I opened a pivot table for the main sheet and in ROWS - admin1, event_type | VALUES - eventy_type. <br><br>
 
13. For J&K, it showed that though riots occurred a lot, peaceful protests were by far the most common occurrence. I copied this data to a new sheet and created a chart for it. This Google sheet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16rP6RiHiuwyh--3JHhkxnTAidpbkBL-4h227kYi8cPI/edit#gid=0 <br><br><br>

 
 
14. In 2019 the Indian government repealed Article 370 which granted a special status to J&K. This abrogation was followed by an intense statewide lockdown for months, including cutting off the internet. This was lifted, very slowly, only in 2021. Yet, protests peaked in 2021, showing that there seems to be a lot of activity in the state despite the history of a harsh lockdown. Even during the lockdown data shows that peaceful events, as well as violence, continued. <br><br>
15. To show this trend of events, I opened up another pivot table. <br><br>
16. PIVOT TABLE: ROWS: sub_event_type, admin1 and year (in that order) and Values: Sub_event_type shows the “J&K Trends over the years” for Peaceful Protests. I again pasted this data onto a new Google sheet to create a chart out of it. This can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1buQk5UO_7WbkQaRb2v_QXUYcJ2m4b94Q3oQcgK6-3ws/edit#gid=0 <br><br><br>
 
 !['Peaceful protests in J&K over the years'](/numberthree.jpg)<br><br> <br>
 
 
17. Peaceful protests peaked in 2021. <br><br>
 
18. Creating a **QGIS map** illustration to show the intensity of peaceful protests in J&K and other states of India since 2016. <br><br>
19. I copied “STATES EVENTS” onto a separate Google sheet, and downloaded it to the computer. I named this file “QGIS”. It can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6hUkkGKETSvNupdqudCt46fSAIdtfG-2rsTz6zJNsc/edit?usp=sharing <br><br>
20. I downloaded an Indian state shapefile from the web. <br><br>
21. In QGIS, I added it as a new vector layer. <br><br>
22. I then added the CSV file (QGIS) by adding a delimited text file layer, and in Geometry chose no geometry as no coordinates are mentioned. <br><br>
23. I right-clicked the map layer and selected Join, and added the CSV file to it.<br> I matched the STATES with the NAME_1 (I checked the attribute table for the shapefile and saw that the state names were given as this). <br><br>
24. I right-clicked the map layer again and went to its Properties, wherein Symbology I selected the Categorize option for EVENTS. I chose the graduated range. <br><br>
25. In the Layer section, I chose to label the states too. <br><br>
 
!['States in India with most peaceful protests'](/MAP.jpg)<br><br> <br>
 
26. The PDF version of this map is: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mKUfn8rlUNSR83WPK3h0HeCFHIIQi3Pd/view?usp=sharing <br><br>
 
27. Now, I wished to show how peaceful protests are progressing over the years since 2016. For this, I chose to create a line chart. For this I chose *Infogram*. <br><br>
28. I copy-pasted the data on “J&K peaceful protest trends” to another google sheet and named it under the same name.<br><br>
29. I wished to compare the trend of J&K with a few other states. Thus, in this new sheet, I copy-pasted the trend values (from the PIVOT TABLE) to adjacent columns. This Sheet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SO9e2vtwBisjzgawprUcDgCkWye_J3tUzIgnBzqgSfU/edit?usp=sharing <br><br>
30. I chose the states which were darker (or with more peaceful protest events occurring). These are Punjab, Uttaranchal (or Uttarakhand). I also chose to include Assam. <br><br>
 
31. I downloaded this CSV file to the computer under the same name. <br><br>
32. In a new Infogram for a line chart, I imported this CSV. <br><br>
33. The result is as follows:<br><br>
 
 !['Peaceful protests over the years'](/Infogram.jpg)
 
* The following chart shows that for all these states except Uttarakhand peaceful protests heave been increasing over the years. <br>
* In 2020 however, even as the pandemic was ongoing and a lockdown was imposed in J&K, protest movements continued J&K, Punjab. <br><br>
* In Punjab, since 2020, farmers have been fighting and agitating against the 3 farm laws that were passed. In J&K, people have been protesting against the abrogation of Article 370, among other issues. <br><br>
* The farmer movement was also present in Uttarakhand and thus the protests occurred there too. <br><br>
 
### **Conclusion** <br><br>
**Protests peaked in the conflict region of J&K in 2021.** <br><br>

35. For this story, I contacted the ACLED as well as Fahad Khan. ACLED responded but has not gotten back to me yet. Fahad Khan, who runs a publication in Kashmir, unfortunately, got arrested for his work. I have contacted various other sources. <br><br><br>
 
## Writing the story <br><br>
 
While writing the story, I realized that I needed more charts.<br><br>
 
36. For each of the charts mentioned in the story, I copied and pasted the data from the main file to a separate sheet after working on it with a pivot table. I used Infogram to do this. <br><br>
37. For example, for the last chart showing how peaceful protests have increased in general across various states, I opened a new pivot table, took that data to a separate Google sheet, and created a chart for it on Infogram. The Google sheet can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16R9_rre0ELC4T79nKPvLoSLI9xSxUrffz7l7Hfru4K4/edit#gid=0 <br><br>
